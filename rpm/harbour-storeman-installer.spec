# Most of the following dependencies are required for both, specifically for
# the `%post` section and additionally as a general requirement after the RPM
# transaction has finished, but shall be already installed on SailfishOS:
Requires:       ssu
Requires(post): ssu
Requires:       PackageKit
Requires(posttrans): PackageKit
# `or` was introduced with RPM 4.13, SailfishOS v2.2.1 started deploying v4.14:
# https://together.jolla.com/question/187243/changelog-221-nurmonjoki/#187243-rpm
# But the SailfishOS-OBS' does not, either due to the antique release or `tar_git`:
# https://github.com/MeeGoIntegration/obs-service-tar-git
# ToDo: Check if the GNU-versions of these packages (named as alternatives below)
# also provide the aliases ("virtual packages") denoted here, then these can be
# used; ultimately most of these packages shall be already installed, anyway.
# 1. `coreutils` (for e.g., `touch` and many other very basic UNIX tools):
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-coreutils or gnu-coreutils)
Requires:       coreutils
# Requires(post,posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-coreutils or gnu-coreutils)
Requires(post,posttrans): coreutils
# 2. `util-linux` for `setsid`:
Requires:       util-linux
Requires(posttrans): util-linux
# 3. `psmisc` for `killall`:
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-psmisc or psmisc-tools)
Requires:       psmisc
# Requires(posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-psmisc or psmisc-tools)
Requires(posttrans): psmisc
# 4. `procps` for `pkill` / `pgrep`: Used `killall` instead, which suits better here.
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-procps or procps-ng)
#Requires:       procps
# Requires(posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-procps or procps-ng)
#Requires(posttrans): procps
# The oldest SailfishOS release Storeman â‰¥ 0.2.9 compiles for, plus the oldest
# useable DoD-repo at https://build.merproject.org/project/subprojects/sailfishos
Requires:       sailfish-version >= 3.1.0
# Provide an automatically presented update candidate for an installed Storeman < 0.2.99:
Conflicts:      harbour-storeman < 0.2.99
Obsoletes:      harbour-storeman < 0.2.99
Provides:       harbour-storeman = 0.3.0~2

- Simplify
* Sat Dec 17 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 1.3.8-release2
- Set umask and PWD in harbour-storeman-installer script
- Start installation of harbour-storeman fully detached ("double fork" / daemonize)
- Print version of harbour-storeman-installer package in the log file entry of each run
- Consistently set files and limit access to group "ssu"
- Refactor and enhance failure of: pkcon repo-set-data harbour-storeman-obs refresh-now true
- Fix according to double-fork-in-shell-code.md: https://github.com/storeman-developers/harbour-storeman-installer/blob/master/double-fork-in-shell-code.md
* Sat Dec 17 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 2.0.49-release1.detached.script
- Fixes, improvements and simplifications
* Wed Dec 14 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 2.0.45-release1.detached.script
- Finalise defer-inst-via-detached-script branch
- Specifically: Only wait for %posttrans scriptlet to finish, not its parent process, because that might be the packagekit daemon (calling functions of libzypp directly; pkcon is just a frontend, which triggers the packagekit daemon to take action), which usually has an idle timeout of 600 seconds (10 minutes) set.
* Sun Dec 11 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 2.0.22-release1.detached.script
- Start harbour-storeman-installer script fully detached ("double fork" / daemonize) in %%posttrans
- Update defer-inst-via-detached-script branch with changes for v1.3.6:
  - Set umask and PWD in harbour-storeman-installer script
  - Start installation of harbour-storeman fully detached ("double fork" / daemonize)
  - Print version of harbour-storeman-installer package in the log file entry of each run
  - Refactor and enhance failure of: pkcon repo-set-data harbour-storeman-obs refresh-now true

- Log file needs to be writeable (#146)
* Wed Dec 07 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 2.0.12-release1.detached.script
- Start the `harbour-storeman-installer` script as detached ("&") in the `%posttrans` scriptlet
- Thus eliminating the necessity for user interaction(s), besides triggering the installation of Storeman Installer
* Sun Dec 04 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 1.3.4-release1
- Radically rewrite `harbour-storeman-installer` script in `/usr/bin` (#136)
- The `harbour-storeman-installer` script ultimately issues `pkcon install harbour-storeman â€¦ &` (i.e., also detached), allowing this script to be removed in the process of the Storeman installation
- Do not use pkcon's option -n; it is slow enough (#134)
* Sat Dec 03 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 1.3.3-release1
- Start pkcon commands with the options -pn (#130)

* Sat Jun 04 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 1.2.9-release1
- pkcon expects options before the command (#74)
* Sun May 15 2022 olf <Olf0@users.noreply.github.com> - 1.2.8-release1
- Requires: sailfish-version >= 3.1.0 (#61), because this is the oldest SailfishOS release any Storeman version installed by Storeman Installer will work on.
