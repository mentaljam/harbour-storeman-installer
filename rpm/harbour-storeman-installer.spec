# The Git tag format must adhere to <release>/<version> since 2023-05-18.
# The <version> tag must adhere to semantic versioning, for details see
# https://semver.org/
Version:        2.2.7
# The <release> tag comprises one of {alpha,beta,rc,release} postfixed with a
# natural number greater or equal to 1 (e.g. "beta3") and may additionally be
# postfixed with a plus character ("+"), the name of the packager and a release
# number chosen by her (e.g. "rc2+jane4").  `{alpha|beta|rc|release}`
# indicates the expected status of the software.  No other identifiers shall be
# used for any published version, but for the purpose of testing infrastructure
# other nonsensual identifiers as `adud` may be used, which do *not* trigger a
# build at GitHub and OBS, when configured accordingly; mind the sorting
# (`adud` < `alpha`).  For details and reasons, see

# Most of the following dependencies are required for both, specifically for
# the %%post scriptlet and additionally as a general requirement after the RPM
# transaction has finished, but shall be already installed on SailfishOS:
Requires:       ssu
Requires(post): ssu
Requires:       PackageKit
Requires(posttrans): PackageKit
# `or` was introduced with RPM 4.13, SailfishOS v2.2.1 started deploying v4.14:
# https://together.jolla.com/question/187243/changelog-221-nurmonjoki/#187243-rpm
# But the SailfishOS-OBS' does not support `or`, either due to the antique OBS
# release or `tar_git`: https://github.com/MeeGoIntegration/obs-service-tar-git
# ToDo: Check if the GNU-versions of these packages (named as alternatives below)
# also provide the aliases ("virtual packages") denoted here, then these can be
# used; ultimately most of these packages shall be already installed, anyway.
# 1. `coreutils` (for e.g. `touch` and many other very basic UNIX tools):
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-coreutils or gnu-coreutils)
Requires:       coreutils
# Requires(post,posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-coreutils or gnu-coreutils)
Requires(post): coreutils
Requires(posttrans): coreutils
# 2. `util-linux` for `setsid`:
Requires:       util-linux
Requires(posttrans): util-linux
# 3. `psmisc` for `killall`:
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-psmisc or psmisc-tools)
Requires:       psmisc
# Requires(posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-psmisc or psmisc-tools)
Requires(posttrans): psmisc
# 4. `procps` for `pkill` / `pgrep`: Used `killall` instead, which suits better here.
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-procps or procps-ng)
#Requires:       procps
# Requires(posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-procps or procps-ng)
#Requires(posttrans): procps
# The oldest SailfishOS release Storeman â‰¥ 0.2.9 compiles for, plus the oldest
# useable DoD-repo at https://build.merproject.org/project/subprojects/sailfishos
Requires:       sailfish-version >= 3.1.0
# Provide an automatically presented update candidate for an installed Storeman < 0.2.99:
Conflicts:      harbour-storeman < 0.2.99
Obsoletes:      harbour-storeman < 0.2.99
Provides:       harbour-storeman = 0.3.0~3

# Three equivalent variants, but the sed-based ones have additional, ugly
# backslashed quoting of all backslashes, curly braces and brackets (likely
# also quotation marks), and a double percent for a single percent character,
# because they were developed as shell-scripts for `%%define <name> %%(<script>)`
# (the same applies to scriplets with "queryformat-expansion" option -q, see 
# https://rpm-software-management.github.io/rpm/manual/scriptlet_expansion.html#queryformat-expansion ):

# Using an extended ("modern") RegEx shortens the sed script, but busybox's sed
# does not support the POSIX option -E for that!  Hence one must resort to the
# non-POSIX option -r for that, without a real gain compared to the basic RegEx:
# %%define _sailfish_version %%(source %%{_sysconfdir}/os-release; echo "$VERSION_ID" | %%{__sed} -r 's/^(\[0-9\]+)\\.(\[0-9\]+)\\.(\[0-9\]+).*/\\1\\2\\3/')
# ~: sailfish_version="$(source %%{_sysconfdir}/os-release; echo "$VERSION_ID" | sed -r 's/^([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+)\.([0-9]+).*/\1\2\3/')"
# Note: Debug output of RPM macros assigned by a %%define statement is best
# done by `echo`s / `printf`s at the start of the %%build section.
# The variant using `cut` and `tr` instead of `sed` does not require extra quoting,
# regardless where it is used (though escaping each quotation mark by a backslash
# might be advisable, when using it inside a %%define statement's `%%()` ).
sailfish_version="$(echo "$VERSION_ID" | cut -s -f 1-3 -d '.' | tr -d '.')"
# Must be an all numerical string of at least three digits:
if echo "$sailfish_version" | grep -q '^[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]*$'

# BTW, `ssu`, `rm -f`, `mkdir -p` etc. *always* return with "0" ("success"), hence
# no appended `|| true` needed to satisfy `set -e` for failing commands outside of
# flow control directives (if, while, until etc.).  Furthermore Fedora Docs etc.
# state that solely the final exit status of a whole scriptlet is crucial: 
# See https://docs.pagure.org/packaging-guidelines/Packaging%3AScriptlets.html

# Hence only the main section of a spec file and likely also `%%(<shell-script>)`
