# Most of the following dependencies are required for both, specifically for
# the %%post scriptlet and additionally as a general requirement after the RPM
# transaction has finished, but shall be already installed on SailfishOS:
Requires:       ssu
Requires(post): ssu
Requires:       PackageKit
Requires(posttrans): PackageKit
# `or` was introduced with RPM 4.13, SailfishOS v2.2.1 started deploying v4.14:
# https://together.jolla.com/question/187243/changelog-221-nurmonjoki/#187243-rpm
# But the SailfishOS-OBS' does not support `or`, either due to the antique OBS
# release or `tar_git`: https://github.com/MeeGoIntegration/obs-service-tar-git
# ToDo: Check if the GNU-versions of these packages (named as alternatives below)
# also provide the aliases ("virtual packages") denoted here, then these can be
# used; ultimately most of these packages shall be already installed, anyway.
# 1. `coreutils` (for e.g., `touch` and many other very basic UNIX tools):
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-coreutils or gnu-coreutils)
Requires:       coreutils
# Requires(post,posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-coreutils or gnu-coreutils)
Requires(post): coreutils
Requires(posttrans): coreutils
# 2. `util-linux` for `setsid`:
Requires:       util-linux
Requires(posttrans): util-linux
# 3. `psmisc` for `killall`:
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-psmisc or psmisc-tools)
Requires:       psmisc
# Requires(posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-psmisc or psmisc-tools)
Requires(posttrans): psmisc
# 4. `procps` for `pkill` / `pgrep`: Used `killall` instead, which suits better here.
# Requires:       (busybox-symlinks-procps or procps-ng)
#Requires:       procps
# Requires(posttrans): (busybox-symlinks-procps or procps-ng)
#Requires(posttrans): procps
# The oldest SailfishOS release Storeman â‰¥ 0.2.9 compiles for, plus the oldest
# useable DoD-repo at https://build.merproject.org/project/subprojects/sailfishos
Requires:       sailfish-version >= 3.1.0
# Provide an automatically presented update candidate for an installed Storeman < 0.2.99:
Conflicts:      harbour-storeman < 0.2.99
Obsoletes:      harbour-storeman < 0.2.99
Provides:       harbour-storeman = 0.3.0~3

# BTW, `ssu`, `rm -f`, `mkdir -p` etc. *always* return with "0" ("success"), hence
# no appended `|| true` needed to satisfy `set -e` for failing commands outside of
# flow control directives (if, while, until etc.).  Furthermore on Fedora Docs it
# is indicated that solely the final exit status of a whole scriptlet is crucial: 
# See https://docs.pagure.org/packaging-guidelines/Packaging%3AScriptlets.html
# or https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Scriptlets/#_syntax

# https://pagure.io/packaging-committee/c/8d0cec97aedc9b34658d004e3a28123f36404324
# Hence I have the impression, that only the main section of a spec file is
# interpreted in a shell called with the option `-e', but not the scriptlets
# (`%%pre*`, `%%post*`, `%%trigger*` and `%%file*`).
